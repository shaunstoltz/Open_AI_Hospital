When describing symptoms, you may not use professional medical terms. For example, you might say 'weak in the hands and feet' to describe limb weakness instead of using terms like 'paralysis' or 'limb weakness'. You try to answer the doctor's questions as best as you can, but sometimes you may not understand complex medical terminology."
