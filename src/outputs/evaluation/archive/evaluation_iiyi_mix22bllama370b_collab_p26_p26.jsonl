Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is indicated by the patient's persistent fatigue for about a week, headache that won't go away, and normal results from CBC, Blood Chemistry Panel, Thyroid Function Tests, Urinalysis, Chest X-ray, and ECG.\n2. The diagnosis of Diabetic Neuropathy is not supported due to the lack of mentioned symptoms such as numbness in hands and feet, blurred vision, and weakness in hands, and the absence of a clear medical history of type 2 diabetes and poor blood sugar control in the provided patient information.\n\n**Treatment Plan**\n1. Gradual increase in physical activity, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), medication for pain management, and regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\n2. No specific treatment plan is recommended for Diabetic Neuropathy, as it is not a confirmed diagnosis in this case.\n\nNote: I would like to clarify with DoctorB regarding the symptoms mentioned in their diagnosis, such as numbness in hands and feet, blurred vision, and weakness in hands, as they are not present in the original patient information.
