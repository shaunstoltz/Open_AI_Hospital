Pulmonary function tests to check for COPD\n\n#Diagnosis#\n\nBased on the information provided and the results of the recommended tests, the diagnosis is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\n\n#Diagnostic Basis#\n\n1. The patient has been experiencing fatigue after activity for more than 2 years, which has significantly worsened in the past week.\n2. The patient has no other accompanying symptoms, and their medical history does not suggest any other underlying conditions that could cause fatigue.\n3. The patient's mental state and diet have been poor recently, which could contribute to fatigue.\n4. The patient has no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, or cerebrovascular disease.\n5. The patient had a partial gastrectomy in 2002 due to gastric perforation, but this is unlikely to be related to their current symptoms.\n6. The results of the recommended tests ruled out anemia, hypothyroidism, depression, sleep apnea, and COPD as possible causes of the patient's fatigue.\n\n#Treatment Plan#\n\n1. The patient should be advised to get adequate rest, eat a balanced diet, and engage in regular physical activity to help manage their fatigue.\n2. The patient may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help manage their mental state and improve their overall well-being.\n3. The patient may also benefit from medications such as antidepressants or stimulants to help manage their fatigue.\n4. The patient should be advised to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, as these substances can exacerbate fatigue.\n5.

CT scan: To evaluate the lungs and determine if the patient has a pulmonary embolism.\n\n#Diagnosis#\n\n1. Heart failure: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and reduced ejection fraction, heart failure is a possible cause of the patient's symptoms.\n2. Coronary artery disease: Despite receiving coronary enlargement treatment, it is possible that the patient has underlying coronary artery disease that is contributing to the symptoms.\n3. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain.\n4. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy: Given the patient's history of long-term alcohol consumption, it is possible that the patient has developed alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which can cause heart failure symptoms.\n5. Anemia: Given the patient's history of fatigue and decreased activity tolerance, it is possible that the patient has anemia, which can cause shortness of breath and fatigue.\n6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Given the patient's history of long-term alcohol consumption, it is possible that the patient has developed COPD, which can cause shortness of breath and fatigue.\n\n#Diagnostic Basis#\n\n1. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and reduced ejection fraction suggest heart failure as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n2. The patient's history of long-term alcohol consumption suggests alcoholic cardiomyopathy as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n3. The patient's history of fatigue and decreased activity tolerance suggest anemia as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n4. The patient's history of long-term alcohol consumption suggests COPD as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n5. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation suggests pulmonary embolism as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n6. The patient's history of coronary enlargement treatment suggests coronary artery disease as a possible cause of the symptoms.\n\n#Treatment Plan#\n\n1. The patient should continue to take their medications as prescribed and avoid any triggers that may worsen their symptoms.\n2. The patient should undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate the structure and function of their heart and determine if they have heart failure or coronary artery disease.\n3. The patient should undergo pulmonary function tests to evaluate their lung function and determine if they have COPD or other lung diseases.\n4. The patient should undergo blood tests to evaluate their blood count, electrolytes, and liver function, and determine if they have anemia or other medical conditions.\n5. The patient should undergo a CT scan to evaluate their lungs and determine if they have a pulmonary embolism.\n6.
