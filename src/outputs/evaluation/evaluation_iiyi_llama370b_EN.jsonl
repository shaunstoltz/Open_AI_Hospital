In the past two years, rosiglitazone was discontinued due to shortage, and Novolone treatment was maintained, with fasting blood sugar controlled at 7-8mmol/L.

Due to poor blood sugar control, insulin therapy was started, and the blood sugar was basically stable after adjusting the dosage. Oral acarbose is administered to control postprandial blood sugar. Intravenous administration of ginkgo leaf extract and lipoic acid improves microcirculation and neurological symptoms. Abnormal Q waves on the electrocardiogram should be considered as coronary heart disease, and coronary CT should be ruled out. Atorvastatin was given for hyperlipidemia and fatty liver.
