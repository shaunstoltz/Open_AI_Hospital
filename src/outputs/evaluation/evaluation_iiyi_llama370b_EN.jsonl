In the past two years, rosiglitazone was discontinued due to shortage, and Novolone treatment was maintained, with fasting blood sugar controlled at 7-8mmol/L. In the past two months, due to irregular medication, he developed blurred vision, dizziness, dry mouth and polydipsia, and lost 7 kilograms in weight. The random blood sugar in the outpatient department was 18.8mmol/L, so he was admitted to the hospital.", "medical_test": "- EKG\n  - Sinus rhythm\n  - III, Abnormal Q wave in lead AVF\n- Color Doppler Ultrasound\n  - fatty liver\n- Chest X-ray\n  - No obvious abnormal signs found\n- blood sugar\n  - Random blood sugar 18.8mmol/L\n  - Fasting blood glucose 13.4mmol/L\n- Glycated hemoglobin\n  - 11.7%\n- C-peptide\n  - 1.902ng/ml\n- Trace protein in urine\n  - 87.22mg/L\n- blood lipids\n  - Triglyceride 2.36mmol/L\n- other\n  - Blood routine, electrolytes, liver and kidney functions are normal", "diagnosis": "1.

Auxiliary examinations showed hyperglycemia, elevated glycated hemoglobin, elevated C-peptide and urinary trace protein, elevated triglycerides, and abnormal Q waves on the electrocardiogram.", "treatment": "The patient underwent a comprehensive examination after admission, and diabetic retinopathy was ruled out by ophthalmology consultation. Due to poor blood sugar control, insulin therapy was started, and the blood sugar was basically stable after adjusting the dosage. Oral acarbose is administered to control postprandial blood sugar. Intravenous administration of ginkgo leaf extract and lipoic acid improves microcirculation and neurological symptoms. Abnormal Q waves on the electrocardiogram should be considered as coronary heart disease, and coronary CT should be ruled out. Atorvastatin was given for hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Urinary trace protein increased, and oral pancreatic kallikreinogenase improved microcirculation.
