However, it's important to talk to a healthcare provider before taking any new medications or supplements.\n(4) The patient's healthcare provider may recommend further testing, such as a urine culture or imaging studies, to help diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms and determine the best course of treatment.\n(5) If the patient is diagnosed with a UTI, the healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. It's important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.\n(6) The patient should also follow up with their healthcare provider to monitor their condition and ensure that the infection has been fully treated."}, "evaluation_result": "Here is the evaluation of the intern doctor's diagnostic results:\n\n# Symptoms\n## Analysis\nThe intern doctor has listed the patient's symptoms, but the understanding of the patient's condition is limited.
