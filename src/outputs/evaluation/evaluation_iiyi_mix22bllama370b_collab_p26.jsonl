Benign cystic nodules are suggested by fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid nodule showing benign cystic nodules, and CT scan results showing nodular lesions in the thyroid gland.\n\n**Treatment Plan**\n1. Monitor thyroid function tests every 6-12 months to ensure that thyroid hormone levels remain within normal limits, and consider thyroid hormone replacement therapy if thyroid hormone levels become low.\n2. Consider surgical consultation for thyroid lobectomy to remove the affected lobe and lymph node, and referral to an endocrinologist to evaluate and manage the thyroid condition and Hashimoto's inflammation.\n3.
