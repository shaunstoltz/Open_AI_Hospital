After admission, a detailed examination was conducted. He was diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis. Imaging showed no distant metastasis and was suitable for surgical treatment. Relevant examinations and preparations were performed before surgery, including hepatic artery chemotherapy drug perfusion embolization. Fever and abnormal liver function occurred after surgery, which improved after anti-infection and liver protection treatment. Two weeks after surgery, the tumor shrank to 5*4cm, and laparoscopic left lateral hepatectomy was performed. Postoperative pathology confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a tumor size of 4.5*5.0*2.8cm, and no residual liver capsule or stump cancer tissue. The postoperative evaluation was T1bN0M0IB stage. Anti-infection, liver protection, and stomach protection treatments were given after surgery.
