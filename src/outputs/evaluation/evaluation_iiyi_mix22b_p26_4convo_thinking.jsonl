The physical examination revealed that the heart rhythm was absolutely irregular and the heart sounds varied in intensity.\n3. The patient has risk factors such as age, drinking and smoking, and has chest tightness and shortness of breath after activity, so coronary heart disease cannot be ruled out.", "treatment": "After admission, treatment was given to reduce cardiac pre- and post-load, including recombinant human natriuretic peptide, furosemide, spironolactone, sacubitril-valsartan, dapagliflozin, metoprolol succinate, aspirin, clopidogrel, and rivar Shaban. Coronary CTA showed no stenotic lesions. Consider alcoholic cardiomyopathy, discontinue dual anti-drug therapy, and continue anti-heart failure treatment. The symptoms were relieved after 8 days. Before discharge, he was educated to stop drinking and take medicine as prescribed by the doctor. A follow-up cardiac ultrasound 3 months later showed that the EF had increased to 54%, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed."}, "doctor_diagnosis": {"patient_id": 1295, "turn": 2, "diagnosis": " #Symptoms#\n\n1. Intermittent chest tightness and shortness of breath for the past 6 months, worsening over the past week.\n2. Occasional palpitations after exertion.\n3. Fatigue and decreased activity tolerance.\n\n#Auxiliary Examinations#\n\n1. Echocardiogram: To assess the function of the heart and the severity of atrial fibrillation.\n2. Stress test: To evaluate how the heart responds to exertion.\n3. Blood tests: To check electrolyte levels, kidney function, and liver function.\n4. Chest X-ray: To check for any signs of heart failure or lung disease.\n\n#Diagnosis#\n\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\n\n#Diagnostic Basis#\n\n1. The patient's history of long-term heavy alcohol consumption.\n2. The presence of atrial fibrillation and a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.\n3. The patient's symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and decreased activity tolerance.\n4. The results of the echocardiogram, stress test, blood tests, and chest X-ray.\n\n#Treatment Plan#\n\n1. Continue current medications for coronary enlargement, anti-platelet, lipid-lowering, and anti-heart failure.\n2. Consider adding a diuretic to manage fluid retention and improve symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to quit drinking alcohol and provide resources for alcohol cessation support.\n4. Recommend a low-sodium diet and regular exercise, as tolerated.\n5.
