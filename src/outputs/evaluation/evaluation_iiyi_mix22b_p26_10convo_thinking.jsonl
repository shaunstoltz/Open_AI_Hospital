He went to a local hospital and his electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. He was treated with Betaloc, but his symptoms did not improve significantly. The symptoms worsened 10 days ago, with asthma, difficulty breathing, inability to lie down, and edema of both lower limbs. After going to the outpatient clinic of our hospital, he was diagnosed with \"the cause of asthma and suffocation is yet to be investigated\" and was subsequently admitted to the ward.

He had a history of hypertension, and cardiac color ultrasound showed EF58%, massive mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and enlargement of both chambers. Chest CT showed pleural effusion, enlarged heart shadow, and coronary artery sclerosis. Taking all factors into consideration, a diagnosis of heart failure was made.", "treatment": "After admission, the BNP was found to be 6181.7ng/l, and the diagnosis of heart failure was clear. Cedilan was given to strengthen the heart, furosemide was used to reduce the load on the heart, and potassium chloride was supplemented, and the symptoms were gradually relieved. The D-dimer test showed 770ug/l, and the cardiac enzyme results were normal. Repeat electrocardiogram showed no dynamic evolution. The physical examination revealed mild enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck and exophthalmos of both eyes. The patient had a history of thyroid nodules. The thyroid function test showed hyperfunction. A thyroid color ultrasound showed an enlarged thyroid gland with bilateral nodules. Treatment with methimazole was given, and the cause of heart failure was considered to be caused by hyperthyroidism. A puncture examination was recommended to rule out malignant lesions, but the family refused."}, "doctor_diagnosis": {"patient_id": 1287, "turn": 2, "diagnosis": " #Symptoms#\n(1) Heart palpitations and shortness of breath for the past 2 months\n(2) Edema in both lower limbs for the past 10 days\n\n#Auxiliary Examinations#\n(1) Electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate heart rhythm and electrical activity\n(2) Chest X-ray to evaluate lungs and heart\n(3) Blood tests to evaluate electrolyte levels, kidney function, and thyroid function\n(4) Echocardiogram to evaluate heart function and structure\n(5) Pulmonary function tests to evaluate lung function\n\n#Diagnosis#\nCongestive heart failure\n\n#Diagnostic Basis#\n(1) Symptoms of heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and edema in lower limbs\n(2) History of hypertension and varicose veins\n(3) Abnormal ECG and echocardiogram results indicating heart dysfunction\n(4) Abnormal blood test results indicating kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances\n\n#Treatment Plan#\n(1) Medication management: Adjust current medication regimen to include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers to improve heart function and reduce fluid buildup\n(2) Lifestyle modifications: Encourage patient to adopt a low-sodium diet, engage in regular exercise, and manage stress levels\n(3) Follow-up appointments: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor patient's progress and adjust treatment plan as needed\n(4) Referral to a cardiologist: Refer patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of their heart condition."}, "evaluation_result": "# Evaluation of Intern Doctor's Diagnostic Results\n\n# Symptoms\n## Analysis\nThe intern doctor has identified the main symptoms of the patient, including heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and edema in both lower limbs.
